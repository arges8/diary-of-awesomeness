# diary-of-awesomeness
Every day we perform activities that are beneficial for us. Sometimes other people make things, or say words that make us feel better. It is common to forget about positive events that occurred during the day and focus more on negative ones. Diary Of Awesomeness is an application that will help you in making notes about all positive events that happened to you.

The app not only will help you recognise how many good things happen in your life, but also will improve your mood in days when you feel worse.
